    <h1>Strawberry  Biscuits</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whether they’re plain or bejeweled with pieces of strawberry and rhubarb, “drop biscuits” are the easiest type of biscuits to make — and feature a wonderfully tender, moist texture.</p>
    <p> So, what’s the catch? They’re not really biscuits. Or, at least they’re not like the classic, flaky, southern-style biscuits that most of us imagine when we think of biscuits. These are much more scone-like, which isn’t an issue, unless you want an actual biscuit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h5>Fruit Mixture:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups cubed rhubarb</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups cubed strawberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Dough:</h5>
       <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

       <li>  3/4 cup cold buttermilk</li></li>
       <h5>Egg Wash (optional):</h5>
      <li>1 large egg (optional)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water (optional)</li>

      <h5>Lemon Icing Drizzle (optional):</h5>
      <li>1/3 cup packed powdered sugar</li>

    <h2>How to Make Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through.

        </li>
        <li>Grate frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4 cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit is coated with flour.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.</li>
        <li>Scoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

        </li>
        <li>Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.</li>
